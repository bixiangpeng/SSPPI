## Abstracts
Recent advances have shown great promise in mining multi-modal protein knowledge for better protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction by enriching the representation of proteins. However, existing solutions lack a comprehensive consideration of both local patterns and global dependencies in proteins, hindering the full exploitation of modal information. Additionally, the inherent disparities between modalities are often disregarded, which may lead to inferior modality complementarity effects. To address these issues, we propose a cross-modality enhanced PPI prediction method from the perspectives of protein Sequence and Structure modalities, namely `SSPPI`. In this framework, our main contribution is that we integrate both sequence and structural modalities of proteins and employ an alignment and fusion method between modalities to further generate more comprehensive protein representations for PPI prediction. Specifically, we design two modal representation modules (`Convformer` and `Graphormer`) tailored for protein sequence and structure modalities, respectively, to enhance the quality of modal representation. Subsequently, we introduce a `Cross-modality enhancer` module to achieve alignment and fusion between modalities, thereby generating more informative modal joint representations. Finally, we devise a `Cross-protein fusion` module to model residue interaction processes between proteins, thereby enriching the joint representation of protein pairs. Extensive experimentation on three benchmark datasets demonstrates that our proposed model surpasses all current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in PPI prediction performance.

##  Usages

* ### Data preparation
  There are three benchmark datasets were adopted in this project, including two binary classification datasets (`Yeast and Multi-species`) and a multi-class classification dataset (`Multi-class`).

   1. __Download processed data__
   
      The data file (`data.zip`) of these three datasets can be downloaded from this [link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1KI4DrDVXInQaM5Wv1_0NSw?pwd=6shz). Uncompress this file to get a 'data' folder containing all the original data and processed data.
      
      ðŸŒ³ Replacing the original 'data' folder by this new folder and then you can re-train or test our proposed model on Yeast, Multi-species or Multi-class.  
      
   3. __Customize your data__
      
      You can reprocess data or customize your own data by executing the following commandï¼š`python data_process.py`
      

* ### Training
  After processing the data, you can retrain the model from scratch with the following command:
  ```text
  For Yeast dataset:
    python my_main.py --datasetname yeast --output_dim 1

  For Multi-species dataset:
    python my_main.py --datasetname multi_species --output_dim 1 --identity any

  For Multi-class dataset:
    python my_main.py --datasetname multi_class --output_dim 7  

   ```
  
  Here is the detailed introduction of the optional parameters when running `my_main.py`:
   ```text
    --datasetname: The dataset name, specifying the dataset used for model training.
    --output_dim: The parameter for specifying the number of PPI categories in the dataset.
    --identity: The threshold of identity, specifying the multi-species dataset under this sequence identity.
    --device_id: The device, specifying the GPU device number used for training.
    --batch_size: The batch size, specifying the number of samples in each training batch.
    --epochs: The number of epochs, specifying the number of iterations for training the model on the entire dataset.
    --lr: The learning rate, controlling the rate at which model parameters are updated.
    --num_workers: This parameter is an optional value in the Dataloader, and when its value is greater than 0, it enables multiprocessing for data processing.
    --rst_path: The parameter for specifying the file saving path.  ```

* ### Pretrained models

   If you don't want to re-train the model, we provide pre-trained model parameters as shown below. 
<a name="pretrained-models"></a>
   | Datasets | Pre-trained models          | Description |
   |:-----------:|:-----------------------------:|:--------------|
   | Yeast    | [model](https://github.com/bixiangpeng/SSPPI/blob/main/model_pkl/yeast/model.pkl) | The pretrained model parameters on the Yeast. |
   | Multi-species     | [model_01](https://github.com/bixiangpeng/SSPPI/blob/main/model_pkl/multi_species/model_01.pkl) &nbsp; , &nbsp; [model_10](https://github.com/bixiangpeng/SSPPI/blob/main/model_pkl/multi_species/model_10.pkl) &nbsp; , &nbsp; [model_25](https://github.com/bixiangpeng/SSPPI/blob/main/model_pkl/multi_species/model_25.pkl) &nbsp; , &nbsp; [model_40](https://github.com/bixiangpeng/SSPPI/blob/main/model_pkl/multi_species/model_40.pkl)  &nbsp; , &nbsp; [model_any](https://github.com/bixiangpeng/SSPPI/blob/main/model_pkl/multi_species/model_any.pkl)      | The Pretrained model parameters on the Multi-species under different sequence identities. |
   | Multi-class    | [model](https://github.com/bixiangpeng/SSPPI/blob/main/model_pkl/multi_class/model.pkl)   | The pretrained model parameters on the Multi-class dataset. |
  
   Based on these pre-trained models, you can perform PPI predictions by simply running the following command:
   ```text
    For Yeast dataset:
      python inference.py --datasetname yeast --output_dim 1
  
    For Multi-species dataset:
      python inference.py --datasetname multi_species --output_dim 1 --identity any
  
    For Multi-class dataset:
      python inference.py --datasetname multi_class --output_dim 7  

   ```
